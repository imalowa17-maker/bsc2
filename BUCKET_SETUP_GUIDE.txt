MANUAL BUCKET CREATION - Step-by-Step Guide
============================================

You're getting a 403 error because the API key doesn't have permission to create buckets.
We need to create the bucket manually through the Supabase Dashboard.

STEP 1: Create the New Bucket
------------------------------
1. Open your browser and go to:
   https://irvcekjiqfjbdifbpgas.supabase.co/project/_/storage/buckets

2. Click the green "New bucket" button

3. Fill in the form:
   - Name: md-awards-storage
   - Toggle "Public bucket" to ON (IMPORTANT!)
   - Click "Create bucket"

STEP 2: Set Storage Policies (Optional but Recommended)
--------------------------------------------------------
If you want to ensure anyone can read files:

1. Go to:
   https://irvcekjiqfjbdifbpgas.supabase.co/project/_/storage/policies

2. Find the "md-awards-storage" bucket

3. Click "New Policy"

4. Choose "For full customization"

5. Create a READ policy:
   - Policy name: Public Read Access
   - Allowed operation: SELECT
   - Policy definition: (bucket_id = 'md-awards-storage')
   - Click "Review" then "Save policy"

6. Create an INSERT policy (for uploads):
   - Policy name: Public Upload Access
   - Allowed operation: INSERT
   - Policy definition: (bucket_id = 'md-awards-storage')
   - Click "Review" then "Save policy"

STEP 3: Test the Bucket
------------------------
After creating the bucket, run:
   python test_new_bucket.py

STEP 4: Update Your Application
--------------------------------
If the test passes, update bsc.py:
   Change line ~127 from:
   bucket_name = "md-awards-files"
   
   To:
   bucket_name = "md-awards-storage"

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
If you still get 404 errors after creating the bucket:
- Make sure "Public bucket" is toggled ON
- Verify the bucket name is exactly "md-awards-storage"
- Check that the policies are created correctly
- Wait 1-2 minutes for changes to propagate

Need help? Check if:
1. The bucket appears in your dashboard
2. The "Public" column shows "Yes" for your bucket
3. You can manually upload a file through the dashboard
